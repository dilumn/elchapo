# Elchapo

Ruby API for Ethereum Blockchain network

## IPC Connection

```ruby
require 'elchapo'

client = Ethereum::Connection.new("/root/.ethereum/rinkeby/geth.ipc")

```

After you create the connection client, you can use all these Ethereum `eth` commands & call those methods.

`client.eth_accounts`

Make sure you are using underscore instead of capitals. Eg: `getBalance` => `get_balance`
